<h1><u>Golfer</u></h1>

<div class="italic"><p><strong> Golf </strong> is a club-and-ball <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport">sport</a> in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p></div>

<p>Golf unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9 or 18 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course contains a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various hazards such as water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers. Each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout.</p> 

<p>Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, especially at the elite level.</p>

<p>The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the <em>Old Course</em> at<em> St Andrews</em> in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest golf tournament, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the <em>Prestwick Golf Club</em> in <em>Ayrshire, Scotland.</em> This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship.</p>

<h2>Origin and history</h2>
<p>While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated.</p>
<p>Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.</p>
<p>Others cite chuiwan (捶丸; "chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries. A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages.</p>
<h2>Rules and regulations</h2>
<p>The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA). With the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the USGA and R&A undertook a complete rewrite. The new rule book came into effect in January 2019.</p>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations, with the "general penalty" defined as two-strokes, and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches. Examples include:</p>

<ul><li>A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds (OB) results in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 18.2).
  With the exception of certain circumstances, a one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player causes their ball to move (Rule 9.4).</li>
  <li>A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player elects to take relief when their ball comes to rest within a red or yellow penalty area (Rule 17), or from an unplayable lie (Rule 19).</li>
  <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for making a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 6.3c).</li>
  <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for hitting a fellow player's ball if both balls lay on the green prior to the stroke (Rule 11.1a).</li>
  <li>Disqualification can result from cheating, signing for a lower score, or failing to adhere to one or more rules that lead to improper play.</li></ul>
